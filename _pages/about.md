I'm an AI Research Scientist at <a href="https://mstack.ai">MStack AI</a>, where I design Chemistry-first AI models for molecule synthesis and chemical supply chains. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Masters of Science in Chemistry from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/" target="_blank">BITS Pilani, Goa Campus</a>.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.deepforestsci.com/" target="_blank">Deep Forest Sciences</a>, where I led the development of <b>DeepRetro</b> — a novel AI framework for retrosynthesis that achieved state-of-the-art results on multi-step synthesis benchmarks. This work was awarded the <b>$100,000 Standard Industries Chemical Innovation Challenge</b>. I completed my master's thesis at <a href="https://yale.edu" target="_blank">Yale University</a> with Prof. <a href="https://krishnaswamylab.org/" target="_blank">Smita Krishnaswamy</a>, working on geometric deep learning for molecule generation.

I'm an active contributor to <a href="https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem" target="_blank">DeepChem</a>, the open-source drug discovery toolkit, and serve as a Google Summer of Code mentor. At BITS Pilani, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin/profile" target="_blank">Ashwin Srinivasan</a> at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/appcair/" target="_blank">APPCAIR</a> on AI for drug discovery.

My research interests span <b>AI for Chemistry, Drug Discovery, Graph Neural Networks, Large Language Models</b>, and <b>Computational Biology</b>.
