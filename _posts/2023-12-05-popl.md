# Rust
## Programming Concepts
### Variables and Mutability
- Variables are immutable in Rust
- Declare them as `mut` if you want to assign a new value to it
- Variables are locked to the scope
	- They can have diff values in diff scopes
	```rust
		let x = 5;
		{
			let x = 6;
			println!("The value of x is: {x}");
			# The value of x is: 6
		}
		println!("The value of x is: {x}");
		# The value of x is: 5
	```
	- This is called shadowing
- The keyword `let` can be used to change type of the variable
	```rust
		let spaces = "   ";
		let spaces = spaces.len();
	```

### Data Types
- Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time
- You need not explicitly declare the variable type during declaration
- Supports tuple destructuring like python
- Memory is protected, incorrect index access is not allowed

### Functions
- Use `fn` keyword to declare a function
- functions dont return values, they return expressions
